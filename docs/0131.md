# Rules for AEP-131: Standard Get method

[aep-131]: https://aep.dev/131

## Get methods: No HTTP body

This rule enforces that all standard `Get` operations omit the HTTP `body`, as
mandated in [AEP-131].

### Details

This rule looks for "get" operations on a path that ends in a path parameter,
and complains if the 'requestBody' field is present.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get book
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get book
      responses:
```

### Disabling

**Important:** HTTP `GET` requests are unable to have an HTTP body, due to the
nature of the protocol. The only valid way to include a body is to also use a
different HTTP method.

## GET methods: Operation ID

This rule enforces that all standard `Get` operations have an operationId field
and that the value begins with "get" (case insensitive).

### Details

This rule looks for "get" operations on a path that ends in a path parameter,
and complains if the 'operationId' field is not present or if the value does
not begin with "get" (case insensitive) or a ":" (for custom get methods).

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  # Missing operationId
  '/books/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get book
      responses:
  # operationId present but does not start with "get"
  '/publishers/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get a publisher
      operationId: FetchPublisher
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get book
      operationId: getBook
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/books/{id}/get/operationId'
    rules:
      aep-131-operation-id: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## GET methods: Response Schema

This rule enforces that all standard `Get` operations have an response body
that represents a resource.

### Details

This rule looks for "get" operations on a path that ends in a path parameter,
and complains if the schema of the 200 response contains the x-aep-resource
specification extension.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get book
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A Book
          content:
            'application/json':
              # Missing x-aep-resource extension
              schema:
                type: object
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get book
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A Book
          content:
            'application/json':
              # Missing x-aep-resource extension
              schema:
                type: object
                'x-aep-extension':
                  singular: book
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/books/{id}/get/responses/200/content/application/json/schema'
    rules:
      aep-131-response-schema: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.
