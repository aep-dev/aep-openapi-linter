# Rules for AEP-131: Standard Get method

[aep-131]: https://aep.dev/131

The `aep-131` rules check the descriptions of standard Get methods, which are
"get" operations on path that ends in a path parameter with no appended action
(indicating a custom method).

## aep-131-operation-id

**Rule**: The operation ID should be Get{resource-singular}

This rule enforces that all standard `Get` methods have an operationId field
with a value that begins with "Get".

### Details

This rule looks for "get" operations on a path that ends in a path parameter,
and complains if the 'operationId' field is not present or if the value does
not begin with "Get" (case insensitive) or a ":" (for custom get methods).

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  # Missing operationId
  '/books/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get book
      responses:
  # operationId present but does not start with "get"
  '/publishers/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get a publisher
      operationId: FetchPublisher
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get book
      operationId: GetBook
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/books/{id}/get/operationId'
    rules:
      aep-131-operation-id: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-131-request-body

**Rule** A get method must not accept a request body.

This rule enforces that all standard `Get` operations omit the HTTP `body`, as
mandated in [AEP-131].

### Details

This rule looks for "get" operations on a path that ends in a path parameter,
and complains if the 'requestBody' field is present.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get book
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get book
      responses:
```

### Disabling

**Important:** HTTP `GET` requests are unable to have an HTTP body, due to the
nature of the protocol. The only valid way to include a body is to also use a
different HTTP method.

## aep-131-required-params

**Rule**: Get methods must have no required parameters other than path
parameters

This rule checks that Get methods have no required parameters other than path
parameters, as mandated in [AEP-131].

### Details

This rule looks at all Get methods and complains if it finds any required
parameters that are not path parameters (which must be required).

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    get:
      description: 'Required query parameter'
      parameters:
        - name: force
          in: query
          required: true
          schema:
            type: boolean
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    get:
      description: 'Only path params are required'
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: force
          in: query
          schema:
            type: boolean
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                type: object
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/books/{id}/get'
    rules:
      aep-131-required-params: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-131-response-body

**Rule**: The response should include the AEP resource.

This rule enforces that all standard `Get` operations have an response body
that represents a resource.

### Details

This rule looks for "get" operations on a path that ends in a path parameter,
and complains if the schema of the 200 response contains the x-aep-resource
specification extension.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get book
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A Book
          content:
            'application/json':
              # Missing x-aep-resource extension
              schema:
                type: object
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    get:
      summary: Get book
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A Book
          content:
            'application/json':
              # Missing x-aep-resource extension
              schema:
                type: object
                'x-aep-extension':
                  singular: book
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/books/{id}/get/responses/200/content/application/json/schema'
    rules:
      aep-131-response-body: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-131-unknown-optional-params

**Rule**: Get methods should have no unknown optional parameters

This rule checks that Get methods have no optional parameters other than
parameters defined in [AEP-131] or other AEPs.

### Details

This rule looks at the parameters all Get methods, and complains if it finds
any optional query parameters that are not described in the AEPs. Optional
parameters allowed on Get methods defined in other AEPs include:

- `read_mask` - defined in [AEP-157]
- `view` - defined in [AEP-157]

[AEP-157]: https://aep.dev/157/

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    get:
      description: Unknown force optional parameter
      parameters:
        - name: force
          in: query
          schema:
            type: boolean
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/publishers/{publisherId}/books/{id}':
    get:
      description: No unknown optional params
      parameters:
        - name: publisherId
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: view
          in: query
          schema:
            enum: ['BASIC', 'FULL']
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/books/get/{id}/parameters/0'
    rules:
      aep-131-unknown-optional-params: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.
