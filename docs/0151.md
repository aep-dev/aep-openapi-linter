# Rules for AEP-151: Long-running operations

[aep-151]: https://aep.dev/151

The `aep-151` rules check that long-running operations follow the proper patterns
for returning `202 Accepted` responses with `Operation` resources, and ensure
that services with long-running operations provide the required operations
endpoints.

## Overview

Long-running operations are operations that take a significant amount of time to
complete. Instead of blocking the client, these operations should return a `202
Accepted` response with an `Operation` resource that can be used to track
progress and retrieve the result.

## aep-151-no-200-success

**Rule**: Long-running operations must return 202 as the only success status code, not 200

This rule ensures that operations returning `202 Accepted` do not also define
`200 OK` as a success response, as mandated in [AEP-151][].

### Details

This rule looks for operations that have a `202` response and complains if they
also have a `200` response defined. Long-running operations must be consistent
in their behavior - they should either always return `202` with an `Operation`,
or never do so.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Book created immediately
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Book'
        '202':
          description: Book creation accepted
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Operation'
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      responses:
        '202':
          description: Book creation accepted
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Operation'
        '400':
          description: Bad request
        '500':
          description: Internal server error
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/books/post/responses'
    rules:
      aep-151-no-200-success: 'off'
```

## aep-151-no-201-success

**Rule**: Long-running operations must return 202 as the only success status code, not 201

This rule ensures that operations returning `202 Accepted` do not also define
`201 Created` as a success response, as mandated in [AEP-151][].

### Details

This rule looks for operations that have a `202` response and complains if they
also have a `201` response defined. Long-running operations should not mix
immediate success responses with asynchronous responses.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Book created immediately
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Book'
        '202':
          description: Book creation accepted
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Operation'
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      responses:
        '202':
          description: Book creation accepted
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Operation'
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/books/post/responses'
    rules:
      aep-151-no-201-success: 'off'
```

## aep-151-no-204-success

**Rule**: Long-running operations must return 202 as the only success status code, not 204

This rule ensures that operations returning `202 Accepted` do not also define
`204 No Content` as a success response, as mandated in [AEP-151][].

### Details

This rule looks for operations that have a `202` response and complains if they
also have a `204` response defined. Long-running operations should not mix
immediate success responses with asynchronous responses.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    delete:
      summary: Delete a book
      responses:
        '204':
          description: Book deleted immediately
        '202':
          description: Book deletion accepted
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Operation'
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    delete:
      summary: Delete a book
      responses:
        '202':
          description: Book deletion accepted
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Operation'
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/books/{id}/delete/responses'
    rules:
      aep-151-no-204-success: 'off'
```

## aep-151-202-content-required

**Rule**: 202 response must define an application/json response body with Operation schema

This rule ensures that `202 Accepted` responses include a content definition
with an `application/json` response body, as mandated in [AEP-151][].

### Details

This rule looks for `202` responses and complains if they do not have a `content`
field with an `application/json` media type defined.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      responses:
        '202':
          description: Book creation accepted
          # Missing content field
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      responses:
        '202':
          description: Book creation accepted
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Operation'
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/books/post/responses/202'
    rules:
      aep-151-202-content-required: 'off'
```

## aep-151-operation-schema

**Rule**: 202 response must define an application/json response body with Operation schema

This rule ensures that the `202` response schema contains the required
properties for an `Operation` resource, as mandated in [AEP-151][].

### Details

This rule validates that the schema for `202` responses includes the required
`Operation` properties: `path`, `done`, `error`, and `response`.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      responses:
        '202':
          description: Book creation accepted
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  path:
                    type: string
                  done:
                    type: boolean
                  # Missing error and response properties
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      responses:
        '202':
          description: Book creation accepted
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  path:
                    type: string
                  done:
                    type: boolean
                  error:
                    type: object
                  response:
                    type: object
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/books/post/responses/202/content/application/json/schema'
    rules:
      aep-151-operation-schema: 'off'
```

## aep-151-operation-properties

**Rule**: Operation schema properties must have correct types

This rule ensures that the `Operation` schema properties have the correct data
types, as mandated in [AEP-151][].

### Details

This rule validates that:
- The `path` property has type `string`
- The `done` property has type `boolean`
- The `error` and `response` properties are objects

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      responses:
        '202':
          description: Book creation accepted
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  path:
                    type: boolean  # Should be string
                  done:
                    type: string   # Should be boolean
                  error:
                    type: object
                  response:
                    type: object
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      responses:
        '202':
          description: Book creation accepted
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  path:
                    type: string
                  done:
                    type: boolean
                  error:
                    type: object
                  response:
                    type: object
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/books/post/responses/202/content/application/json/schema/properties'
    rules:
      aep-151-operation-properties: 'off'
```

## aep-151-operations-endpoint

**Rule**: Services with long-running operations must define an operations endpoint with list and get operations

This rule ensures that services with long-running operations provide the
required operations endpoints for querying operation status, as mandated in
[AEP-151][].

### Details

This rule checks that if any operation returns a `202` response, the service
must define:
- `/v1/operations` endpoint with a `get` operation (for listing operations)
- `/v1/operations/{operation}` endpoint with a `get` operation (for getting a specific operation)

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      responses:
        '202':
          description: Book creation accepted
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Operation'
  # Missing operations endpoints
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      responses:
        '202':
          description: Book creation accepted
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Operation'
  '/v1/operations':
    get:
      summary: List operations
      responses:
        '200':
          description: List of operations
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  operations:
                    type: array
                    items:
                      $ref: '#/components/schemas/Operation'
  '/v1/operations/{operation}':
    get:
      summary: Get operation
      parameters:
        - name: operation
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Operation details
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Operation'
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific service, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json'
    rules:
      aep-151-operations-endpoint: 'off'
```
