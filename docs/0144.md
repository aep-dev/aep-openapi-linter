# Rules for AEP-144: Array fields

[aep-144]: https://aep.dev/144

## aep-144-operation-id

**Rule**: The operation ID must begin with the word add or remove.

This rule enforces that all standard `UpdateArray` methods have an operationId
field with a value that begins with "add" or "remove" prefix.

### Details

This rule looks for "UpdateArray" operations and complains if the 'operationId'
field is not present or if the value does not begin with "add" or "remove".

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  # Missing operationId
  '/books:addBook':
    post:
      summary: Add book
      responses:
  # operationId present but does not start with "remove"
  '/publishers:removePublisher':
    post:
      summary: Delete publisher
      operationId: deletePublisher
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books:removeBook':
    post:
      summary: Remove book
      operationId: removeBook
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/books:removeBook/post/operationId'
    rules:
      aep-144-operation-id: 'off'
```

## aep-144-http-method

**Rule**: An Update Array operation must be POST.

This rule enforces that all `UpdateArray` operations use POST method.

### Details

This rule looks for "UpdateArray" operations and complains if operation uses
anything except POST method.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books:removeBook':
    delete:
      summary: Remove book
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books:removeBook':
    post:
      summary: Remove book
      responses:
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/books:removeBook/delete/operationId'
    rules:
      aep-144-http-method: 'off'
```
