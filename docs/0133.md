# Rules for AEP-133: Standard Create method

[AEP-133]: https://aep.dev/133

## aep-133-id-parameter

**Rule**: Create method should allow the user to specify the ID component of
the resource.

This rule enforces that declarative-friendly create methods include a
client-specified ID query parameter, as mandated in [AEP-133].

### Details

This rule looks at the parameters of "post" operations on a path that does not
have a ":" in its final segment (indicating a custom operation), and complains
if there is no parameter with the name `id`.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1':
    post:
      description: 'No parameters'
  '/test2':
    post:
      description: 'No id parameter'
      parameters:
        - name: force
          in: query
          schema:
            type: boolean
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Ok
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/book':
    post:
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/post'
    rules:
      aep-133-id-parameter: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-133-operation-id

**Rule**: The operation ID should be Create{resource-plural}

This rule enforces that all standard `Create` methods have an operationId field
with a value that begins with "Create".

### Details

This rule looks for "post" operations on a path that does not end in a path
parameter, and complains if the 'operationId' field is not present or if the
value does not begin with "Create" (case insensitive) or a ":" (for custom
methods).

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  # Missing operationId
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      responses:
  # operationId present but does not start with "Create"
  '/publishers':
    post:
      summary: Create a publisher
      operationId: MakePublisher
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      summary: Create a book
      operationId: CreateBook
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/books/post/operationId'
    rules:
      aep-133-operation-id: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-133-param-types

**Rule**: The id parameter must be a query parameter

This rule checks that the id parameter is a query parameter, as mandated in
[AEP-133].

### Details

This rule looks at the parameters of "post" operations on a path that does not
have a ":" in its final segment (indicating a custom operation), and complains
if the parameter with name of "id" is not a query parameter with type string.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1':
    post:
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: header
          schema:
            type: string
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1':
    post:
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/post/parameters/0'
    rules:
      aep-133-param-types: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-133-request-body

**Rule**: A standard Create method must accept the resource in the request body

This rule checks that Create methods accepts the resource to be created in the
body of the request, as mandated in [AEP-133].

### Details

This rule looks at "post" operations on a path that does not have a ":" in its
final segment (indicating a custom operation), and complains if there is no
requestBody defined, or if the requestBody does not define a "content" with a
schema that is an AEP resource.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1':
    post:
      description: 'No request body'
  '/test2':
    post:
      description: 'Request body is not a resource'
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    post:
      operationId: CreateBook
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              'x-aep-resource':
                singular: book
                plural: books
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/post/parameters/0'
    rules:
      aep-133-request-body: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-133-required-params

**Rule**: Create method must have no required parameters other than path
parameters

This rule checks that Create methods have no required parameters other than
path parameters, as mandated in [AEP-133].

### Details

This rule looks at the parameters of "post" operations on a path that does not
have a ":" in its final segment (indicating a custom operation), and complains
if it finds any required parameters that are not path parameters (which must be
required).

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1':
    post:
      parameters:
        - name: force
          in: query
          required: true
          schema:
            type: boolean
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}/test2':
    post:
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: force
          in: query
          schema:
            type: boolean
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/post/parameters/0'
    rules:
      aep-133-required-params: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-133-response-body

**Rule**: A standard Create method must return the resource in the response
body

This rule checks that Create methods return the resource in the body of the
response, as mandated in [AEP-133].

### Details

This rule looks at "post" operations on a path that does not have a ":" in its
final segment (indicating a custom operation), and complains if there is no
responses defined, no 200 or 201 response, or if any response does not define a
"content" with a schema that is an AEP resource.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1':

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-133-unknown-optional-params

**Rule**: Create methods should have no unknown optional parameters

This rule checks that Create methods have no optional parameters other than
parameters defined in [AEP-133] or other AEPs.

### Details

This rule looks at the parameters of "post" operations on a path that does not
have a ":" in its final segment (indicating a custom operation), and complains
if it finds any optional query parameters that are described in the AEPs.
Currently the only allowed optional query parameter is `id`, described in
[AEP-133].

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1':
    post:
      parameters:
        - name: force
          in: query
          schema:
            type: boolean
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{testId}/test2':
    post:
      parameters:
        - name: testId
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: id
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/post/parameters/0'
    rules:
      aep-133-unknown-optional-params: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.
