# Rules for AEP-133: Standard Create method

[AEP-133]: https://aep.dev/133

## Create methods: No required parameters other than path parameters

This rule checks that Create methods have no required parameters other than
path parameters, as mandated in [AEP-133].

### Details

This rule looks at the parameters of "post" operations on a path that does not
have a ":" in its final segment (indicating a custom operation), and complains
if it finds any required parameters that are not path parameters (which must be
required).

## Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1':
    post:
      parameters:
        - name: force
          in: query
          required: true
          schema:
            type: boolean
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}/test2':
    post:
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: force
          in: query
          schema:
            type: boolean
```

## Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/post/parameters/0'
    rules:
      aep-132-request-required-params: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## Create methods: No unknown optional parameters

This rule checks that Create methods have no optional parameters other than
parameters defined in [AEP-133] or other AEPs.

### Details

This rule looks at the parameters of "post" operations on a path that does not
have a ":" in its final segment (indicating a custom operation), and complains
if it finds any optional query parameters that are described in the AEPs.
Currently the only allowed optional query parameter is `id`, described in
[AEP-133].

## Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1':
    post:
      parameters:
        - name: force
          in: query
          schema:
            type: boolean
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{testId}/test2':
    post:
      parameters:
        - name: testId
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: id
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
```

## Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/post/parameters/0'
    rules:
      aep-132-request-unknown-optional-params: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.
