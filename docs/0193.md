# Rules for AEP-193: Errors

[aep-193]: https://aep.dev/193

## aep-193-error-response-schema

**Rule**: Error response schema should contain all required fields of the
correct type.

This rule enforces that all 4xx and 5xx responses have valid schema according
to AEP-193 rule.

### Details

This rule looks at the 4xx and 5xx responses and reports if either one of
required parameters is missing or if it has incorrect type.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1':
    get:
      description: '404 response schema is missing required fields: type, detail, instance and title'
      responses:
        200:
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                type: 'object'
                properties:
                  results:
                    type: string
        404:
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                type: 'object'
                properties:
                  status:
                    type: 'integer'
  '/test2':
    get:
      description: '404 response schema detail property is of incorrect type'
      404:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: 'object'
              properties:
                status:
                  type: 'integer'
                type:
                  type: 'string',
                detail:
                  type: 'integer',
                instance:
                  type: 'string',
                title:
                  type: 'string',
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    get:
      responses:
        404:
          content:
            'application/json':
              schema:
                type: 'object'
                properties:
                  status:
                    type: 'integer'
                  type:
                    type: 'string',
                  detail:
                    type: 'string',
                  instance:
                    type: 'string',
                  title:
                    type: 'string',
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/books/get'
    rules:
      aep-193-error-response-schema: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.
