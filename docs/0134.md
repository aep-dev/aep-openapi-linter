# Rules for AEP-134: Standard Update method

[AEP-134]: https://aep.dev/134

The `aep-134` rules check the descriptions of standard Update methods, which
are "patch" operations on path that ends in a path parameter with no appended
action (indicating a custom method).

## aep-134-content-type

**Rule**: The method must support MIME type "application/merge-patch+json"

This rule ensures that all Update methods define a request body with
content-type of "application/merge-patch+json".

### Details

This rule checks all Update methods and complains if the method does not define
a `requestBody`, the `requestBody` does not contain a `content` field, or if
the `content` field does not contain an entry for the
"application/merge-patch+json" MIME type.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    patch:
      description: 'No request body'
  '/test2/{id}':
    patch:
      description: 'Request body is not merge-patch+json'
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: object
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
'/test1/{id}':
  patch:
    description: 'Request body is merge-patch+json'
    requestBody:
      content:
        'application/merge-patch+json':
          schema:
            type: object
    responses:
      200:
        description: Ok
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/{id}/patch'
    rules:
      aep-134-content-type: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-134-operation-id

**Rule**: The `operationId` should be Update{resource-singular}.

This rule enforces that all Update methods have an operationId field with a
value that begins with "Update".

### Details

This rule checks all Update methods and complains if the `operationId` field is
not present or if the value does not begin with "Update" (case insensitive).

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    patch:
      operationId: 'modifyTest1'
      description: 'Incorrect operationId'
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/merge-patch+json':
            schema:
              type: object
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    patch:
      operationId: 'updateTest1'
      description: 'Correct operationId'
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/merge-patch+json':
            schema:
              type: object
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/{id}/patch'
    rules:
      aep-134-operation-id: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-134-request-body

**Rule**: The request body schema must be the resource itself.

This rule checks that all Update methods accepts the resource to be updated in
the body of the request, as mandated in [AEP-134].

### Details

This rule checks all Update methods and complains if there is no `requestBody`
defined, or if the `requestBody` does not define a `content` with a schema that
is an AEP resource.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    patch:
      description: 'No request body defined'
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
  '/test2/{id}'
    patch:
      description: 'Request body is not an aep resource'
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/merge-patch+json':
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    patch:
      description: 'Request body is an aep resource'
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/merge-patch+json':
            schema:
              type: object
              'x-aep-resource':
                singular: book
                plural: books
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/books/{id}/patch'
    rules:
      aep-134-request-body: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-134-required-params

**Rule**: Update methods must have no required parameters other than path
parameters

This rule checks that Update methods have no required parameters other than
path parameters, as mandated in [AEP-134].

### Details

This rule looks at all Update methods and complains if it finds any required
parameters that are not path parameters (which must be required).

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    patch:
      description: 'Required query parameter'
      parameters:
        - name: force
          in: query
          required: true
          schema:
            type: boolean
```

paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    patch:
      description: 'Only path params are required'
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:

    rules:
      aep-134-required-params: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-134-response-body

**Rule**: The response schema must be the resource itself.

This rule checks that Update methods return the resource in the body of the
response, as mandated in [AEP-134].

### Details

This rule looks at all Update methods and complains if there is no `responses`
field, no 200 response, or if the 200 response does not define a `content` with
a schema that is an AEP resource.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    patch:
      description: 'No request body'
  '/test2/{id}':
    patch:
      description: 'Request body is not a resource'
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/merge-patch+json:
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/post/parameters/0'
    rules:
      aep-134-response-body: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-134-unknown-optional-params

**Rule**: Update methods should have no unknown optional parameters

This rule checks that Update methods have no optional parameters other than
parameters defined in [AEP-134] or other AEPs.

### Details

This rule looks at the parameters all Update methods, and complains if it finds
any optional query parameters that are described in the AEPs. Currently there
are no allowed optional query parameters for an Update method.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    patch:
      description: Unknown force optional parameter
      parameters:
        - name: force

          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/books/patch/{id}/parameters/0'
    rules:
      aep-134-unknown-optional-params: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.
