# Rules for AEP-136: Custom Methods

[aep-136]: https://aep.dev/136

## aep-136-http-method

**Rule**: Custom methods should use POST or GET.

This rule enforces that all `Custom` operations use POST or GET methods.

### Details

This rule looks for "custom" operations and complains if operation uses
anything except POST or GET methods.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}:archive':
    delete:
      summary: Archive book
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}:archive':
    post:
      summary: Archive book
      responses:
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/books/{id}:archive/delete/operationId'
    rules:
      aep-136-http-method: 'off'
```

## aep-136-no-patch-delete

**Rule**: Custom methods should not use PATCH or DELETE.

This rule enforces that all `Custom` operations do not use PATCH or DELETE
methods.

### Details

This rule looks for "custom" operations and complains if operation uses PATCH
or DELETE methods.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}:archive':
    delete:
      summary: Archive book
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}:archive':
    post:
      summary: Archive book
      responses:
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/books/{id}:archive/delete/operationId'
    rules:
      aep-136-no-patch-delete: 'off'
```

## aep-136-custom-operation-id

**Rule**: The operation ID should start with a colon and a capital letter

This rule enforces that all `Custom` methods start with a colon and a capital
letter.

### Details

This rule looks for "custom" operations on a path that ends in a path
parameter, and complains if the 'operationId' field is not present or if the
value does not begin with ":" and a capital letter.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  # Missing operationId
  '/books/{id}:archive':
    delete:
      summary: Archive a book
      responses:
  # operationId present but does not start with ":"
  '/publishers/{id}:refresh':
    delete:
      summary: Refresh publisher
      operationId: RefreshPublisher
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}:archive':
    delete:
      summary: Archive a book
      operationId: :ArchiveBook
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/books/{id}:archive/delete/operationId'
    rules:
      aep-136-custom-operation-id: 'off'
```

## aep-136-get-idempotency

**Rule** GET-based custom methods must be idempotent and have no request body.

This rule enforces that all Custom `Get` operations omit the HTTP `body`, as
mandated in [AEP-136].

### Details

This rule looks for Custom "get" operations and complains if the 'requestBody'
field is present.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}:archive':
    get:
      summary: Archive a book
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}:archive':
    get:
      summary: Archive book
      responses:
```

### Disabling

**Important:** HTTP `GET` requests are unable to have an HTTP body, due to the
nature of the protocol. The only valid way to include a body is to also use a
different HTTP method.
