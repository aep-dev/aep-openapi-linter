# Rules for AEP-132: List method

[aep-132]: https://aep.dev/132

## aep-132-http-body

**Rule**: A list operation must not accept a request body.

This rule enforces that all `List` operations omit the HTTP `body`, as mandated in [AEP-132][].

### Details

This rule looks for "get" operations on a path that does not end in a path parameter, and complains if the 'requestBody'
field is present.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    get:
      summary: List books
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    get:
      summary: List books
      responses:
```

### Disabling

**Important:** HTTP `GET` requests are unable to have an HTTP body, due to the nature of the protocol. The only valid
way to include a body is to also use a different HTTP method (as depicted above).

## aep-132-operation-id

**Rule**: The operation ID should be list{resource-plural}

This rule enforces that all standard `List` operations have an operationId field and that the value begins with "list"
(case insensitive).

### Details

This rule looks for "list" operations on a path that does not end in a path parameter, and complains if the
'operationId' field is not present or if the value does not begin with "list" (case insensitive) or a ":" (for custom
methods).

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  # Missing operationId
  '/books':
    get:
      summary: list books
      responses:
  # operationId present but does not start with "list"
  '/publishers':
    get:
      summary: List publishers
      operationId: GetAllPublishers
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    get:
      summary: List books
      operationId: listBooks
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to the Spectral rule file for the specific
file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/books/get/operationId'
    rules:
      aep-132-operation-id: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the Spectral rule file for the specific file
without a fragment.

## aep-132-param-types

**Rule**: List operation must use the correct type for any optional parameters.

This rule enforces that all `List` standard methods use the correct type for any optional parameters described in
[AEP-132][].

## Details

This rule looks at the query parameters of "get" operations on a path that does not end in a path parameter, and
complains if it finds

- a parameter named `filter` that is not `type: string`
- a parameter named `order_by` that is not `type: string`
- a parameter named `show_deleted` that is not `type: boolean`

## Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1':
    get:
      parameters:
        - name: filter
          in: query
          schema:
            type: object
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1':
    get:
      parameters:
        - name: filter
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
```

## Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to the Spectral rule file for the specific
file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/get/parameters/0'
    rules:
      aep-132-param-types: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the Spectral rule file for the specific file
without a fragment.

## aep-132-required-params

**Rule**: List operation should have no required parameters (except path parameters)

This rule enforces that all `List` standard methods do not have unexpected required parameters, as mandated in
[AEP-132][].

### Details

This rule looks at the parameters of "get" operations on a path that does not end in a path parameter, and complains if
it finds any required parameters that are not path parameters (which must be required).

## Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1':
    get:
      parameters:
        - name: force
          in: query
          required: true
          schema:
            type: boolean
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}/test2':
    get:
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: force
          in: query
          schema:
            type: boolean
```

## Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to the Spectral rule file for the specific
file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/get/parameters/0'
    rules:
      aep-132-required-params: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the Spectral rule file for the specific file
without a fragment.
