# Rules for AEP-132: List method

## List methods: No HTTP body

This rule enforces that all `List` operations omit the HTTP `body`, as mandated
in [AEP-132][].

### Details

This rule looks for "get" operations on a path that does not end in a path
parameter, and complains if the 'requestBody' field is present.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    get:
      summary: List books
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books':
    get:
      summary: List books
      responses:
```

### Disabling

**Important:** HTTP `GET` requests are unable to have an HTTP body, due to the
nature of the protocol. The only valid way to include a body is to also use a
different HTTP method (as depicted above).
