# Rules for AEP-135: Delete method

[aep-135]: https://aep.dev/135

## Delete methods: No HTTP body

This rule enforces that all `Delete` operations omit the HTTP `body`, as
mandated in [AEP-135][].

### Details

This rule looks for "delete" operations and complains if the 'requestBody'
field is present.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    delete:
      summary: Delete book
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    delete:
      summary: Delete book
      responses:
```

### Disabling

**Important:** HTTP `DELETE` requests are unable to have an HTTP body, due to
the nature of the protocol. The only valid way to include a body is to also use
a different HTTP method (as depicted above).

## Delete methods: Response 204

This rule enforces that all `Delete` operations return a "204" (No Content)
response.

### Details

This rule looks for "delete" operations and complains if "responses" does not
have a "204" property.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    delete:
      summary: Delete book
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Ok
        '4xx':
          description: Client error
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    delete:
      summary: Delete book
      responses:
        '204':
          description: Book was deleted
        '4xx':
          description: Client error
```

### Disabling

Use the "overrides" field of the ruleset file to override a specific instance.
Include a comment explaining why the pattern could not be followed.
