# Rules for AEP-135: Delete method

[aep-135]: https://aep.dev/135

## aep-135-http-body

**Rule**: A delete operation must not accept a request body.

This rule enforces that all `Delete` operations omit the HTTP `body`, as mandated in [AEP-135][].

### Details

This rule looks for "delete" operations and complains if the 'requestBody' field is present.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    delete:
      summary: Delete book
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    delete:
      summary: Delete book
      responses:
```

### Disabling

**Important:** HTTP `DELETE` requests are unable to have an HTTP body, due to the nature of the protocol. The only valid
way to include a body is to also use a different HTTP method (as depicted above).

## aep-135-operation-id

**Rule**: The operation ID should be Delete{resource-singular}

This rule enforces that all standard `Delete` methods have an operationId field with a value that begins with "Delete".

### Details

This rule looks for "delete" operations on a path that ends in a path parameter, and complains if the 'operationId'
field is not present or if the value does not begin with "Delete" (case insensitive) or a ":" (for custom methods).

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  # Missing operationId
  '/books/{id}':
    delete:
      summary: Delete a book
      responses:
  # operationId present but does not start with "delete"
  '/publishers/{id}':
    delete:
      summary: Delete a publisher
      operationId: RemovePublisher
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    delete:
      summary: Delete a book
      operationId: DeleteBook
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to the Spectral rule file for the specific
file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/books/{id}/delete/operationId'
    rules:
      aep-135-operation-id: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the Spectral rule file for the specific file
without a fragment.

## aep-135-response-204

**Rule**: A delete operation should have a `204` response.

This rule enforces that all `Delete` operations return a "204" (No Content) response.

### Details

This rule looks for "delete" operations and complains if "responses" does not have a "204" property.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    delete:
      summary: Delete book
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Ok
        '4xx':
          description: Client error
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    delete:
      summary: Delete book
      responses:
        '204':
          description: Book was deleted
        '4xx':
          description: Client error
```

### Disabling

Use the "overrides" field of the ruleset file to override a specific instance. Include a comment explaining why the
pattern could not be followed.
