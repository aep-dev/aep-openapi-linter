# Rules for AEP-137: Standard Apply method

[AEP-137]: https://aep.dev/137

The `aep-137` rules check the descriptions of standard Apply methods, which are
"put" operations on path that ends in a path parameter with no appended action
(indicating a custom method).

## aep-137-operation-id

**Rule**: The `operationId` should be Apply{resource-singular}.

This rule enforces that all Apply methods have an operationId field with a
value that begins with "Apply".

### Details

This rule checks all Apply methods and complains if the `operationId` field is
not present or if the value does not begin with "Apply" (case insensitive).

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    put:
      operationId: 'updateTest1'
      description: 'Incorrect operationId'
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: object
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    put:
      operationId: 'applyTest1'
      description: 'Correct operationId'
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: object
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/{id}/put'
    rules:
      aep-137-operation-id: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-137-request-body

**Rule**: The request body schema must be the resource itself.

This rule checks that all Apply methods accepts the resource to be replaced in
the body of the request, as mandated in [AEP-137].

### Details

This rule checks all Apply methods and complains if there is no `requestBody`
defined, or if the `requestBody` does not define a `content` with a schema that
is an AEP resource.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    put:
      description: 'No request body defined'
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
  '/test2/{id}'
    put:
      description: 'Request body is not an aep resource'
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    put:
      description: 'Request body is an aep resource'
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: object
              'x-aep-resource':
                singular: book
                plural: books
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/books/{id}/put'
    rules:
      aep-137-request-body: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-137-required-params

**Rule**: Apply methods must have no required parameters other than path
parameters

This rule checks that Apply methods have no required parameters other than path
parameters, as mandated in [AEP-137].

### Details

This rule looks at all Apply methods and complains if it finds any required
parameters that are not path parameters (which must be required).

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    put:
      description: 'Required query parameter'
      parameters:
        - name: force
          in: query
          required: true
          schema:
            type: boolean
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    put:
      description: 'Only path params are required'
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: force
          in: query
          schema:
            type: boolean
      requestBody:
        content:
          'application/json':
            schema:
              type: object
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/books/{id}/put'
    rules:
      aep-137-required-params: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-137-response-body

**Rule**: The response schema must be the resource itself.

This rule checks that Apply methods return the resource in the body of the
response, as mandated in [AEP-137].

### Details

This rule looks at all Apply methods and complains if there is no `responses`
field, no 200 response, or if the 200 response does not define a `content` with
a schema that is an AEP resource.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    put:
      description: 'No request body'
  '/test2/{id}':
    put:
      description: 'Request body is not a resource'
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: string
      responses:
        200:
          description: Ok
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/books/{id}':
    put:
      operationId: ApplyBook
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              'x-aep-resource':
                singular: book
                plural: books
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/test1/post/parameters/0'
    rules:
      aep-137-response-body: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.

## aep-137-unknown-optional-params

**Rule**: Apply methods should have no unknown optional parameters

This rule checks that Apply methods have no optional parameters other than
parameters defined in [AEP-137] or other AEPs.

### Details

This rule looks at the parameters all Apply methods, and complains if it finds
any optional query parameters that are described in the AEPs. Currently there
are no allowed optional query parameters for an Apply method.

### Examples

**Incorrect** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/test1/{id}':
    put:
      description: Unknown force optional parameter
      parameters:
        - name: force
          in: query
          schema:
            type: boolean
```

**Correct** code for this rule:

```yaml
paths:
  '/publishers/{publisherId}/books/{id}':
    put:
      description: No unknown optional params
      parameters:
        - name: publisherId
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
```

### Disabling

If you need to violate this rule for a specific operation, add an "override" to
the Spectral rule file for the specific file and fragment.

```yaml
overrides:
  - files:
      - 'openapi.json#/paths/books/put/{id}/parameters/0'
    rules:
      aep-137-unknown-optional-params: 'off'
```

If you need to violate this rule for an entire file, add an "override" to the
Spectral rule file for the specific file without a fragment.
